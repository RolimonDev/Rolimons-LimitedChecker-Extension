# Rolimons-LimitedChecker-Extension
Hello everyone, since i removed poison checking on the Rolimons.com for obvious reasons, ive decided to make a limited checker here.

Since the limited checker is unpacked and hasnt been approved from chrome yet, heres how you can download this extension. 
1. Download the files as a .zip 
2. Head over to chrome://extensions 
3. At the top right click on Developer mode 
4. Then click on "Load unpacked" 
The files that u downloaded from here should be in a folder since u downloaded it as a .zip, so click on the folder u downloaded and click "open" 
After that pin the extension and find the UAID of the item and put it inside the box, afterwards click on "Limited Status" and it will tell u if its pois or not
